# ckl-WebServer
This is a personal project coded in HTML, PHP, and CSS. The webserver is for viewing stats, leaderboards, and server info.

# Important Note
This is my first time working with HTML, PHP, and CSS and a lot of trial and error was performed. I know there is a lot better methods to accomplish what I was trying to do. If I had the time I would go back and rewrite the code to be more efficent and use better methods to reduce redundant code and etc.

# General Info
The following API's and libraries were used:
https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Source-Query -> Used for retreving game server information at certian IPs.
https://github.com/SmItH197/SteamAuthentication -> Used to allow login via the Steam API.

The following plugins are used to send data from the gameserver to a SQL database:
https://github.com/WardPearce/SQLMatches -> Sends match information to an SQL database.
https://github.com/rogeraabbccdd/Kento-Rankme -> Sends all player data to a SQL database.

# Implementation
Overall design was created using HTML and CSS. Then simply using the SQL database, the data is then displayed.
